# What does that mean for me?
Concretely, that means you may do whatever you want with the template given you attribute the author(s) _appropriately_.  This is a sufficiently vague term granting a lot of freedom to the user.  I personally recommend just giving this repository (and Alexander Weinert's) a star to fulfil your obligation.  If the topic ever comes up, rather than sharing "your" template, give people a link to this repo.  I do not expect nor particularly want you to acknowledge the author(s) any more than that.  It's just a template after all.  

Note that the license also requires you to indicate changes:  In the eyes of the author(s), you indicate changes by entering your name and content in the files.  Don't sweat it.
