Here, you should acknowledge everyone who has helped you in any way, shape, or form to write this work.
It is customary to first the advisor, then colleagues, then the reviewers, maybe funding agencies, if you would like, then personal contacts.
Feel free to vary this order as you would like. 

For the first version that goes to the reviewers, this section may be omitted, in particular, as you do not yet (officially) know your reviewers.
